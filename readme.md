Howto
--------
Please do not put the index.php into your productive environment. Its only a demo.
You need a PHP server (of course, APACHE recommended) and a MySQL database. I will add some initial SQL-Queries soon.
Please provide your database-credentials into the config/config.php file. 
More docu coming.
